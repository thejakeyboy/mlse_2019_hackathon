# Welcome to the 2019 MLSE Hackathaon at Georgia Tech!

Here I'll give some instructions on how to compete in the hackathon.

First, the data files are as follows:

- [The Relay Bike Data](./relay_ride_data_cleaned.csv)
  - This dataset contains one month of rides taken as part of the [Relay Bike Share Program](http://relaybikeshare.com/). We provide the start time and end of the ride, the latitude and longitude of the stations, the cost of the ride, etc.
- [The weather conditions dataset](./atlanta_weather_data_clean.csv)
  - Blah
