# Welcome to the 2019 MLSE Hackathaon at Georgia Tech!

Here I'll give some instructions on how to compete in the hackathon.

## The Goal

Participants, your job today is to try to address the following, in whatever way you can: **How is use of the relay bike system affected by the weather and crime that occured in Atlanta?**

Important things to remember:
- I highly recommend you form a group! Groups of up to 3 persons max are fine.
- This task is *open ended*, you can address whatever question you feel is most interesting and can be analyzed using the available data. 
- You will be judged on (a) the interesting-ness of the question you asked, (b) how crafty your methods and tools were,  (c) how interesting are the answers you find, and (d) how well you present your findings.
- Be creative! While we provide some started code with one possible direction, try to consider novel ideas that would set your solutions apart.

## The Data

First, the data files are as follows:

- [The Relay Bike Data, mid-September to mid-October 2017](./relay_ride_data_cleaned.csv)
    - This dataset contains one month of rides taken as part of the [Relay Bike Share Program](http://relaybikeshare.com/). We provide the start time and end of the ride, the latitude and longitude of the stations, the cost of the ride, etc.
- [The weather dataset](./atlanta_weather_data_clean.csv)
    - What were the weather conditions, hour by hour, in Atlanta during the same period?
- [Crime in Atlanta during this month](./atlanta_crime_occurance_data_cleaned.csv)
    - What crime events were recorded by the Atlanta Police Department?


## How to get started

We have a couple of helper files, with code and descriptions, to get you all off the ground.

- [GT MLSE Data Hackathon -- Starter Code.ipynb]("./GT MLSE Data Hackathon -- Starter Code.ipynb"). If you are a pyhon hacker, and you like the pandas library, this code should help you get started. We explore some simple ideas that connect the weather, day of the week, and hour of the day, to the amount of use of the relay bike program.
- If you are more of an R hacker, a slightly different analysis can be found in [R_code_starter.Rmd](R_code_starter.Rmd)

## How to submit your solution

You need to put together a *presentation* as a final submission. I highly recommend you use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) as it is easy to share with several people, as well as the judge(s).
